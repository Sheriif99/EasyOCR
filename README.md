# Book Cover OCR Model

This OCR (Optical Character Recognition) model is designed to extract titles from images of book covers. It utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize and extract text from book cover images, enabling automated title extraction for various applications.

## Features

- Accurately extracts titles from book cover images.
- Handles various font styles, sizes, and orientations commonly found on book covers.
- Supports different image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and GIF.
- Fast and efficient text extraction using advanced OCR algorithms.
- Works well with both printed and handwritten book titles.
- Provides options for pre-processing and image enhancement to improve recognition accuracy.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage

1. Prepare your book cover image by placing it in the `images` directory.
2. Run the OCR model script:
Replace `book_cover.jpg` with the actual filename of your book cover image.

3. The model will process the image and extract the title, displaying the result in the console output.

## Model Training

The OCR model has been pre-trained on a large dataset of book cover images to recognize and extract titles. The training process involved:

- Data collection and annotation of book cover images with ground truth titles.
- Pre-processing and augmentation of the dataset to increase its diversity.
- Training the model using a deep learning architecture, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
- Fine-tuning and optimization to achieve high accuracy in title extraction.

Please note that retraining the model on a custom dataset may require additional steps and resources, including labeled training data and access to GPU resources.
